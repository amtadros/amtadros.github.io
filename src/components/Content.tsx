            Symptoms of complexity:

                Change Amplification: seemingly simple change requires code
                modifications in many different places.

                Cognitive Load: how much a developer needs to know in order to
                complete a task. A higher cognitive load means that developers
                have to spend more time learning the required information, and
                there is a greater risk of bugs because they have missed
                something important. Sometimes an approach that requires more
                lines of code is actually simpler, because it reduces cognitive
                load.
              </ListItem>
              <ListItem>
                Unknown Unknowns: An unknown unknown means that there is
                something you need to know, but there is no way for you to find
                out what it is, or even whether there is an issue. One of the
                most important goals of good design is for a system to be
                obvious. An obvious system is one where a developer can make a
                quick guess about what to do, without thinking very hard, and
                yet be confident that the guess is correct.

                between monoliths vs microservices might have us thinking
